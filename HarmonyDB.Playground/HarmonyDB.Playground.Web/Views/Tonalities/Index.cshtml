<h1 class="display-4">Tonalities Analysis</h1>

<p>
    The Tonalities section offers tools for analyzing the harmonic structures of songs and loops. It uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) models to process audio features, aiming to identify patterns such as predominant tonality, tonic, and scale confidence scores.
</p>

<p>
    EM models help in determining the most likely tonality by processing harmonic elements like chords and melodies. This method iteratively refines its predictions, improving the accuracy of identifying tonal structures.
</p>

<p>
    The analysis includes tonality confidence scores, which reflect the certainty of the model's predictions. These scores help in understanding the clarity of the tonal characteristics of songs and loops.
</p>

<p>
    A database of known tonalities supports the analysis, allowing for comparison and validation of results. This aids in making the predictions more accurate and relevant.
