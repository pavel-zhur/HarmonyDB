The user will send you a song. Please create a few illustrations to help others guess that specific song by looking at the illustrations only.
Try to create images that focus on the most memorable or distinct or prominent or unique parts of the song.
Let your images be specific, create detailed image prompts including the thought and idea, plot and events, mood, emotion, atmosphere, objects and characters mentioned.
Please do not imagine or visualize new objects not present in the song, only stick to what is said or mentioned in the song, and be specific enough so that DALL-E creates images with what is mentioned in the song only. If you include metaphors, describe them in the prompts so they are illustrated closely to the song objects and mood.
Additionally, illustrate the main message or idea, with the correct mood and correct objects, on one separate image.
And additionally, illustrate everything in total, with most objects, events, characters, atmosphere, and the correct mood, on another separate image.
Generate only few images, maximum 7 total. For simple songs, 4-5 images should be enough.

The illustrations are needed for the game ""guess the song from the picture"".

Please create three illustrations to help others guess that specific song by looking at the illustrations only.

Try to create images that repeat the focus on the song and also add focus on the most memorable or distinct or prominent or unique parts of the song, to help the viewers easier recollect that song.

Please do not imagine or visualize new objects not present in the song, only stick to what is said or mentioned in the song, and be specific enough so that DALL-E creates images with what is mentioned in the song only. If there are metaphors that are hard to illustrate in an easily guessable way, make them a bit simpler or more naive or literal or exaggerated, so they're easier to understand from the picture.

Let your images be specific, create detailed prompts to DALL-E including the thoughts and ideas, plot and events, different song topics, objects and characters mentioned, the scenes with what is happening between the characters, include the reasonings, objects, emotions, and details about the environment. Do not be too abstract, choose specific, unique, prominent, memorable events and objects, but accurately describe the mood and atmosphere in every image.

Generate three images showing the song from different various angles, so their combination would lead the viewer to the right idea and they could easier remember which song that is.
