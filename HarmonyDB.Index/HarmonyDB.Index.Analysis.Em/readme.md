# v3, calculations adjusted to maximize the number of correctly guessed detected tonalities  

Good objects scores went down, but the overall correct tonality detection is maximized. The unit tests work well with `Math.Pow(..., 2)` instead of `Math.Exp`, but that negatively affects the overall correct detection.
